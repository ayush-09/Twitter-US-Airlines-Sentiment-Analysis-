# Twitter-US-Airlines-Sentiment-Anlysis

In this I compare three supervised learning algorithms on the Twitter US Airline Dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment
- Naive Bayes
- KNeighbors Nearest
- RandomForest

In the **TSE.py** file you can check all the models with respective accuracy of each model after run this file.<br />

In the **Supervised Learning** file I train the best model from all the previous one and predict the result.<br>

Its colab notebook you dont need to run, it already shown the output.

One model is **Tfidf** model o transform the text into vector and the other is ***RandomForest*** Model with best accuracy.
